## 📌 About This Project

This is a responsive and minimalistic **developer portfolio website** that includes:

- A **hero section** with profile photo and intro
- Sections for **About Me**, **Projects**, and **Contact**
- Fully functional **mobile navigation** with animated menu
- Stylish **CV download** and **GitHub** buttons

I’m currently **learning TypeScript**, and this project has been a great hands-on opportunity to explore it in practice. I’m still actively improving and refactoring parts of the code as I learn more.
